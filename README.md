## Description
This is our solution for the NASA Space Apps 2023 hackathon at the Immersed in the Sounds of Space challenge.
Our app transforms images into sounds and offers a space for meditation for people of all ages and stages of life.

## Sustainability
- Simple UI, doesn't require a lot of energy to run
- It enhances brain function, productivity etc. through meditation induced by calming sounds and visual stimulation
- Servers that host data run on solar energy, as opposed to the starry night theme of the app
- Raising awareness through educational videoclips
- Offline premium content

## Profitability
We offer the possibility of accessing offline meditation sources, by buying a monthly subscription plan
that allows you to download the sound contents generated using our app.

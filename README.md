# AstroCAN
## Description
This is our solution for the NASA Space Apps 2023 hackathon at the Immersed in the Sounds of Space challenge.
We developed an image to sound recognition algorithm that is used in the application and enables users to upload any image (altough we recomment spatial images from NASA) and generate sounds based on them and offers a space for meditation for people of all ages and stages of life.
Users can also access a Learning side of the page, see the About, Pricing and Contact sections.
For future development, we wish to continue this project in order to aid visually impaired individuals.

## Demo
To be soon added.

## Used technologies
- MATLAB
- Python
- HTML5
- CSS3
- React
- Bootstrap

## Sustainability
- Simple UI, doesn't require a lot of energy to run
- It enhances brain function, productivity etc. through meditation induced by calming sounds and visual stimulation
- Servers that host data run on solar energy, as opposed to the starry night theme of the app
- Raising awareness through educational videoclips
- Offline premium content
We offer the possibility of accessing offline meditation sources, by buying a monthly subscription plan
that allows you to download the sound contents generated using our app.
